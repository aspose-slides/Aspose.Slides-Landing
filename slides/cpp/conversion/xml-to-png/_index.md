// User defined dimension
int desiredX = 1200;
int desiredY = 800;

// Getting scaled value  of X and Y
float ScaleX = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Width()) * desiredX;
float ScaleY = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Height()) * desiredY;

// Create a custom scale image
auto bitmap = slide->GetThumbnail(ScaleX, ScaleY);

bitmap->Save(u"output.png", ImageFormat::get_Png());
	
//Iterate through each slide via index and convert

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language that is similar to HTML but different in using tags for defining objects. The whole idea behind creation of XML file format was to store and transport data without being dependent on software or hardware tools. Its popularity is due to it being both human as well as machine readable. This enables it to create common data protocols in the form of objects to be stored and shared over network such as World Wide Web (WWW). The "X" in XML is for extensible which implies that the language can be extended to any number of symbols as per user requirements. It is for these features that many standard file formats make use of it such as Microsoft Open XML, LibreOffice OpenDocument, XHTML and SVG.

PNG, Portable Network Graphics, refers to a type of raster image file format that use loseless compression. This file format was created as a replacement of Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) and has no copyright limitations. However, PNG file format does not support animations. PNG file format supports loseless image compression that makes it popular among its users. With the passage of time, PNG has evolved as one of the mostly used image file format. Almost all Operating Systems have support for opening PNG files. For example, Microsoft Windows viewer has the capability to open PNG files as the OS has by default the support available as part of installation.
