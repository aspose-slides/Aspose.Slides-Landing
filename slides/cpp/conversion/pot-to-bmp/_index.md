// Access the first slide
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);

// User defined dimension
int desiredX = 1200;
int desiredY = 800;

// Getting scaled value  of X and Y
float ScaleX = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Width()) * desiredX;
float ScaleY = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Height()) * desiredY;

// Create a custom scale image
auto bitmap = slide->GetThumbnail(ScaleX, ScaleY);

bitmap->Save(u"output.bmp", ImageFormat::get_Bmp());
	
//Iterate through each slide via index and convert

Files with .POT extension represent Microsoft PowerPoint template files created by PowerPoint 97-2003 versions. Files created with these versions of Microsoft PowerPoint are in binary format as compared to those created in Office OpenXML file formats using the higher versions of PowerPoint. The files, hence, generated can be used to create presentations that have same layout and other settings required to be applied to new files. These settings can include styles, backgrounds, colour palette, fonts and defaults. Such files are generated in order to create ready-to-use template files for official use.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="BMP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/" >}}

Files having extension .BMP represent Bitmap Image files that are used to store bitmap digital images. These images are independent of graphics adapter and are also called device independent bitmap (DIB) file format. This independency serves the purpose of opening the file on multiple platforms such as Microsoft Windows and Mac. The BMP file format can store data as two-dimensional digital images  in both monochrome as well as color format with various colour depths.
