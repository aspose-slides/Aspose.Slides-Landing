 In order to convert EMF to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.slides) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Slides.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 C++ developers can easily convert EMF file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load EMF file with Aspose.Slides for C++ Presentation Object.
1.  Select the first slide.
1.  Set the desired dimensions.
1.  Get the thumbnail with desired dimensions.
1.  Call Save() method having JPEG output parameter .
1.  Open JPEG file in compatible program.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the C++ conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with C++ Runtime Environment for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit.
- Aspose.Slides for C++ DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="EMF to JPEG C++ Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// Load the EMF
SharedPtr<Presentation> pres = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"sourceFile.emf");

// Access the first slide
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);

// User defined dimension
int desiredX = 1200;
int desiredY = 800;

// Getting scaled value  of X and Y
float ScaleX = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Width()) * desiredX;
float ScaleY = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Height()) * desiredY;

// Create a custom scale image
auto bitmap = slide->GetThumbnail(ScaleX, ScaleY);

bitmap->Save(u"output.jpeg", ImageFormat::get_Jpeg());
	
//Iterate through each slide via index and convert

 Slides and Presentation API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="EMF" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/emf/" >}}

Enhanced metafile format (EMF) stores graphical images device-independently. Metafiles of EMF comprises of variable-length records in chronological order that can render the stored image after parsing on any output device. These variable-length records can be definitions of enclosed objects, commands for drawing, and graphics properties critical to render the image accurately. When a device opens an EMF metafile using its own graphics environment, the proportions, dimensions, colors and other graphic properties of original image remains same regardless of the opening device platform.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
