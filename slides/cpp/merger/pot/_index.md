 In order to merge POT file, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document merger API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.slides) 
 package manager, search for

+  Load both POT files.
+  Use get\_Slides() method to iterate through each slide.
+  Use AddClone function to merge with the desired file.
+  Use Save() method to save at specified path

Files with .POT extension represent Microsoft PowerPoint template files created by PowerPoint 97-2003 versions. Files created with these versions of Microsoft PowerPoint are in binary format as compared to those created in Office OpenXML file formats using the higher versions of PowerPoint. The files, hence, generated can be used to create presentations that have same layout and other settings required to be applied to new files. These settings can include styles, backgrounds, colour palette, fonts and defaults. Such files are generated in order to create ready-to-use template files for official use. Read More
