 Aspose.Slides API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. вЂЋ

+  Load both ODP files.
+  Use get\_Slides() method to iterate through each slide.
+  Use AddClone function to merge with the desired file.
+  Use Save() method to save at specified path
