 In order to render PPS to SVG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-slides) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Java developers can easily convert PPS file to SVG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PPS file with an instance of Presentation class
1.  Call the Presentation.save method while specifying output file path & SaveFormat
1.  SVG file will be saved at the specified path

```cs
// instantiate a Presentation object that represents a PPS file
Presentation pres = new Presentation("template.pps");
try {
    // Access the first slide
    ISlide sld = pres.getSlides().get_Item(0);

    // Create a memory stream object
    FileOutputStream svgStream = new FileOutputStream("output.svg");

    // Create SVG image of slide and save in memory stream
    sld.writeAsSvg(svgStream);

    svgStream.close();
} catch (IOException e) {
} finally {
    pres.dispose();
}

 Slides and Presentation API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="PPS" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/presentation/pps/" >}}

PPS, PowerPoint Slide Show, files are created using Microsoft PowerPoint for Slide Show purpose. PPS file reading and creation is supported by Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003. The more latest version of this file format is PPSX which is based on Office OpenXML standards. PPS files can still be read by latest versions of Microsoft PowerPoint, but newly created files can only be saved in PPSX file format. When a PPS file is shared with another user and opened, it starts as Powerpoint show unlike PPT file which opens in editable mode.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="SVG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/svg/" >}}

SVG files are Scalable Vector Graphics Files that use XML based text format for describing the appearance of image. The word Scalable refers to the fact that the SVG can be scaled to different sizes without losing any quality. Text based description of such files make them independent of resolution. It is one of the mostly used format for building website and print graphics in order to achieve scalability. The format can only be used for two-dimensional graphics though. SVG files can be viewed/opened in almost all modern browsers including Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Safari.
