1.  Load PPTM file with an instance of Presentation class
1.  Iterate through each Slide in the Presentation
1.  Create a full scale image as a Bitmap with each iteration
1.  Call Bitmap.save method with GIF file extension & ImageFormat

 Aspose.Slides API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice.

Files with PPTM extension are Macro-enabled Presentation files that are created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or higher versions. They are similar to PPTX files with the difference that the lateral can't execute macros though they can contain macros. PPTM files can be edited by opening them in Microsoft PowerPoint and updating the contents. Another similar format is PPSM but it is read-only by default and starts the slideshow when opened. PPTM, like PPTX, contains slides for different presentation elements like text, images, videos, graphs and other related material.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
