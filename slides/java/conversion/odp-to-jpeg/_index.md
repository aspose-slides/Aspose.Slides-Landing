 In order to render ODP to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-slides) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

 Aspose.Slides API makes it easy for the developers to convert ODP file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load ODP file with an instance of Presentation class
1.  Iterate through each Slide in the Presentation
1.  Create a full scale image as a Bitmap with each iteration
1.  Call Bitmap.save method with JPEG file extension & ImageFormat

 Aspose.Slides API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. ‎

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="ODP" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/presentation/odp/" >}}

Files with ODP extension represent presentation file format used by OpenOffice.org in the OASISOpen standard. A presentation file is a collection of slides where each slide can comprise of text, images, formatting, animations, and other media. These slides are presented to audience in the form of slideshows with custom presentation settings. ODP files can be opened by applications that conform to the OpenDocument format (such as OpenOffice or StarOffice).

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="JPEG" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}

A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
