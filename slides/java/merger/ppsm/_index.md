 In order to merge PPSM file, weвЂ™ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use merger API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-slides)

 Aspose.Slides API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice. вЂЋ

Files with PPSM extension represent Macro-enabled Slide Show file format created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 or higher. Another similar file format is PPTM which differs in opening with Microsoft PowerPoint in editable format instead of running as Slide Show. When run as slide show, the PPSM file shows the presentation slides with contents intact in the slide show and is in read-only mode by default. PPSM files can still be edited in Microsoft PowerPoint by opening it in PowerPoint. Read More
