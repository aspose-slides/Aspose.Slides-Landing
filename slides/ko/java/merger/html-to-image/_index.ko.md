[**Aspose.Slides for Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/ko/java/) is a powerful Java library used to merge and manipulate presentations, HTML docs, and other files. When you merge HTML to image, you are effectively combining the contents in HTML documents to obtain a single image.

```java

Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try {
    pres.getSlides().addFromHtml(new StreamReader("file1.html"));
    pres.getSlides().addFromHtml(new StreamReader("file2.html"));

    for (int index = 0; index < pres.getSlides().size(); index++)
    {
        ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().get_Item(index);
        BufferedImage bufferedImage = slide.getThumbnail();
        ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, "PNG", new File("image_java_" + index + ".png"));
    }
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
