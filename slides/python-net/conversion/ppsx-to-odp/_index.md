Need to convert PPSX files to ODP programmatically? Using [*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) any developer can convert PPSX to ODP format with just a few lines of Python code.

As a modern presentation processing API, Aspose.Slides for Python creates ODP from PPSX quickly. Test the quality of PPSX to ODP conversion right in your [browser](https://products.aspose.app/slides/conversion). Aspose PowerPoint PPTX library allows you to convert PPSX files to many popular formats.

You can install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) using the following pip command:
