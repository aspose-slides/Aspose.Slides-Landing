Need to convert PPSM files to BMP programmatically? With [*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) any developer can convert PPSM to BMP format with just a few lines of Python code.

Modern presentation-processing Python API creates BMP from PPSM with high speed. Test the quality of PPSM to BMP conversion right in a [browser](https://products.aspose.app/slides/conversion). Powerful PowerPoint Python library allows converting PPSM files to many popular formats.

You can install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) using the following pip command:
