Need to convert PPS files to POTX programmatically? With [*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) any developer can convert PPS to POTX format with just a few lines of Python code.

Modern presentation-processing Python API creates POTX from PPS with high speed. Test the quality of PPS to POTX conversion right in a [browser](https://products.aspose.app/slides/conversion). Powerful PowerPoint Python library allows converting PPS files to many popular formats.

You can install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) using the following pip command:
