 In order to convert PPTX to JPEG, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.slides.net) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Slides 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET developers can easily load & convert PPTX files to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PPTX file with an instance of Presentation class
1.  Iterate through each Slide in the Presentation
1.  Create a full scale image as a Bitmap with each iteration
1.  Call Bitmap.Save method with JPEG file extension & ImageFormat.Jpeg as parameters

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows PPTX to JPEG C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
using (var presentation = new Presentation("template.pptx"))
{
    // iterate over all slides in the presentation
    foreach (var slide in presentation.Slides)
    {
        // create a full scale image
        var bitmap = slide.GetThumbnail(1f, 1f);

        // save the image to disk in JPEG format
        bitmap.Save(string.Format("Slide_{0}.jpeg", slide.SlideNumber), System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
    }
}

Files with PPTX extension are presentation files created with popular Microsoft PowerPoint application. Unlike the previous version of presentation file format PPT which was binary, the PPTX format is based on the Microsoft PowerPoint open XML presentation file format. A presentation file is a collection of slides where each slide can comprise of text, images, formatting, animations, and other media. These slides are presented to audience in the form of slideshows with custom presentation settings.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="jpeg" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/" >}}
A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image.  The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality. JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images.
