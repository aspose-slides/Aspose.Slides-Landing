        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="POTX" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/presentation/potx/" >}}
Files with .POTX extension represent Microsoft PowerPoint template presentations that are created with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 and above. This format was created to replace the POT file format that is based on the binary file format and is supported with PowerPoint 97-2003. The files generated can be used to create presentations that have same layout and other settings required to be applied to new files. These settings can include styles, backgrounds, colour palette, fonts and defaults. Such files are generated in order to create ready-to-use template files for official use.

        {{< blocks/products/pf/agp/about-file-text fileFormat="swf" readMoreLink="https://docs.fileformat.com/page-description-language/swf/" >}}
SWF is a file format used to transport text, video, vector graphics and ActionScript over the internet and supported by Adobe Flash Player. The SWF file format is designed to be a resourceful transfer format, not only for exchanging graphics but also provides supports for anti-aliasing and on-screen display. Anti-aliasing is a feature that is critical  for fast rendering of bitmap and its associated characteristics like interactive buttons, shading and animation .etc.
