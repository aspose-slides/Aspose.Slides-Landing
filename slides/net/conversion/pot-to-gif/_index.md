 In order to convert POT to GIF, we’ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C# platform. Open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.slides.net) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Slides 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

 .NET developers can easily load & convert POT files to GIF in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load POT file with an instance of Presentation class
1.  Iterate through each Slide in the Presentation
1.  Create a full scale image as a Bitmap with each iteration
1.  Call Bitmap.Save method with GIF file extension & ImageFormat.Gif as parameters

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="This sample code shows POT to GIF C# Conversion" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
using (var presentation = new Presentation("template.pot"))
{
    // iterate over all slides in the presentation
    foreach (var slide in presentation.Slides)
    {
        // create a full scale image
        var bitmap = slide.GetThumbnail(1f, 1f);

        // save the image to disk in GIF format
        bitmap.Save(string.Format("Slide_{0}.gif", slide.SlideNumber), System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Gif);
    }
}

Files with .POT extension represent Microsoft PowerPoint template files created by PowerPoint 97-2003 versions. Files created with these versions of Microsoft PowerPoint are in binary format as compared to those created in Office OpenXML file formats using the higher versions of PowerPoint. The files, hence, generated can be used to create presentations that have same layout and other settings required to be applied to new files. These settings can include styles, backgrounds, colour palette, fonts and defaults. Such files are generated in order to create ready-to-use template files for official use.

A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.
