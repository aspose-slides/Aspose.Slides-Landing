[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/pt/python-net/) is a powerful Python library used to merge and manipulate presentations, HTML docs, and other files. When you merge HTML to image, you are effectively combining the contents in HTML documents to obtain a single image.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    pres.slides.remove_at(0)
    pres.slides.add_from_html(htmlText1)
    pres.slides.add_from_html(htmlText2)

    for sld in pres.slides:
        bmp = sld.get_thumbnail(1, 1)
        bmp.save("Slide_{num}.png".format(num=str(sld.slide_number)), drawing.imaging.ImageFormat.png)
