 Aspose.Slides API can be used to read, write, manipulate and convert Microsoft PowerPoint documents to PDF, XPS, HTML, TIFF, ODP and various other formats. One can create new files from scratch and save those in the relevant supported formats. Aspose.Slides is a standalone API for creating, parsing or manipulating presentations, slides and elements and it does not depend on any software like Microsoft or OpenOffice.

A file with PPT extension represents PowerPoint file that consists of a collection of slides for displaying as SlideShow. It specifies the Binary File Format used by Microsoft PowerPoint 97-2003. A PPT file can contain several different types of information such as text, bulleted points, images, multimedia and other embedded OLE objects. Microsoft came up with newer file format for PowerPoint, known as PPTX, from 2007 onwards that is based on Office OpenXML and is different from this binary file format. Several other application programs such as OpenOffice Impress and Apple Keynote can also create PPT files.
