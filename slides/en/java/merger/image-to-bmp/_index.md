[**Aspose.Slides for Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/) is a powerful Java library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, PDFs, images, and other files. When you merge image to BMP, you are effectively combining images to obtain a single BMP file.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java/), you can merge image to BMP quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Java code for merging Image to BMP" offSpacer="true" %}}
```java

Presentation pres = new Presentation();
try {
    IPPImage image1 = pres.getImages().addImage(Files.readAllBytes("image1.png"));
    pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addPictureFrame(ShapeType.Rectangle, 0, 0, 100, 100, image1);

    IPPImage image2 = pres.getImages().addImage(Files.readAllBytes("image2.png"));
    pres.getSlides().get_Item(0).getShapes().addPictureFrame(ShapeType.Rectangle, 0, 200, 100, 100, image2);

    for (int index = 0; index < pres.getSlides().size(); index++)
    {
        ISlide slide = pres.getSlides().get_Item(index);
        BufferedImage bufferedImage = slide.getThumbnail();
        ImageIO.write(bufferedImage, "BMP", new File("image_java_" + index + ".bmp"));
    }
} finally {
    if (pres != null) pres.dispose();
}
```
