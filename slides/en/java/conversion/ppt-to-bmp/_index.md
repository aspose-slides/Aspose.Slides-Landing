 In order to render PPT to BMP, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use conversion API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-slides) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.

```cs
// load PPT with Aspose.Slides
Presentation presentation = new Presentation("template.ppt");
   
    // iterate over all slides in the presentation
for (ISlide sld : presentation.getSlides()) 
{
  
  // create a full scale image of each slide
  BufferedImage bi = sld.getThumbnail(new RenderingOptions());

  // create a new file of type BMP for every slide
  File outputfile = new File(sld.getSlideNumber() + ".bmp");
  
  // save the slide image to disk
  ImageIO.write(bi, "bmp", outputfile);
}
