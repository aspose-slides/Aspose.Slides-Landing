 In order to parse ODP file, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for Java](https://products.aspose.com/slides/java) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use parsing API for Java platform. You can download its latest version directly from
 [Maven](https://repository.aspose.com/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/repo/com/aspose/aspose-slides) 
 and install it within your Maven-based project by adding the following configurations to the pom.xml.
