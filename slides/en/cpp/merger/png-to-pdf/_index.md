[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, images, and other files. When you merge PNG to PDF, you are effectively combining PNG images to obtain a single PDF file.

```cpp

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
        
auto image1 = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image1.png"));
pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image1);
auto image2 = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image2.png"));
pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0.0f, 200.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image2);

pres->Save(u"pres.pdf", SaveFormat::Pdf);
```
