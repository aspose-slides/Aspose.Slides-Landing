[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, PDFs, and other documents. When you merge PDF to PDF, you are effectively combining pages from 2 documents to obtain one PDF file. Aspose.Slides allows you merge PDFs in different ways. You get to merge PDFs with all their shapes, styles, texts, formatting, etc.
