[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to merge and manipulate presentations, images, and other files. When you merge SVG to PNG, you are effectively combining SVG images to get a PNG picture.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), you can merge SVG to PNG files quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for merging SVG to PNG" offSpacer="true" %}}
```cpp

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
String svgContent = IO::File::ReadAllText(svgPath);
	SharedPtr<ISvgImage> svgImage = System::MakeObject<SvgImage>(svgContent);
	SharedPtr<IPPImage> ppImage = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(svgImage);
	pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, static_cast<float>(ppImage->get_Width()), static_cast<float>(ppImage->get_Height()), ppImage);

for (int32_t index = 0; index < pres->get_Slides()->get_Count(); index++)
{
    auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(index);
    auto fileName = String::Format(u"slide_{0}.png", index);
    slide->GetThumbnail()->Save(fileName, ImageFormat::get_Png());
}
```
