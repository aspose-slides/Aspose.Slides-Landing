[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to merge and manipulate presentations, images, and other files. When you merge JPG to JPG, you are effectively combining two images to get one picture.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), you can merge JPG files quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for merging JPG to JPG" offSpacer="true" %}}
```cpp

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
        
auto image1 = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image1.jpg"));
pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0.0f, 0.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image1);
auto image2 = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image2.jpg"));
pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0)->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0.0f, 200.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image2);

for (int32_t index = 0; index < pres->get_Slides()->get_Count(); index++)
{
    auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(index);
    auto fileName = String::Format(u"slide_{0}.jpg", index);
    slide->GetThumbnail()->Save(fileName, ImageFormat::get_Jpeg());
}
