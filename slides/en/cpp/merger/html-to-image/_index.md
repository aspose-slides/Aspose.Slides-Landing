[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to merge and manipulate presentations, HTML docs, and other files. When you merge HTML to image, you are effectively combining the contents in HTML documents to obtain a single image.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/), you can merge image files quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for merging HTML to image" offSpacer="true" %}}
```cpp

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();

pres->get_Slides()->RemoveAt(0);
pres->get_Slides()->AddFromHtml(htmlText1);
pres->get_Slides()->AddFromHtml(htmlText2);

for (int32_t index = 0; index < pres->get_Slides()->get_Count(); index++)
{
    auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(index);
    auto fileName = String::Format(u"slide_{0}.png", index);
    slide->GetThumbnail()->Save(fileName, ImageFormat::get_Png());
}
