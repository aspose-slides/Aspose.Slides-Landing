[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) and [**Aspose.Words for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/words/cpp/) are powerful C++ libraries used to manipulate and convert PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and other files. When you convert PowerPoint to Word, you are essentially moving the contents of a presentation's slides to pages in a Word document.
