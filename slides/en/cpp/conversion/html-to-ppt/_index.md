[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to create, convert, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, HTML docs, and other files. When you convert HTML to PPT, you are essentially moving the contents in an HTML document to slides in a PowerPoint presentation.
