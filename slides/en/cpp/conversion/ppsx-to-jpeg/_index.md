 In order to convert PPSX to JPEG, weâ€™ll use
 [Aspose.Slides for C++](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) 
 API which is a feature-rich, powerful and easy to use document manipulation and conversion API for C++ platform. You can download its latest version directly, just open
 [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/aspose.slides) 
 package manager, search for
 Aspose.Slides.Cpp 
 and install. You may also use the following command from the Package Manager Console.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 C++ developers can easily convert PPSX file to JPEG in just a few lines of code.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

1.  Load PPSX file with Aspose.Slides for C++ Presentation Object.
1.  Select the first slide.
1.  Set the desired dimensions.
1.  Get the thumbnail with desired dimensions.
1.  Call Save() method having JPEG output parameter .
1.  Open JPEG file in compatible program.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

 Before running the C++ conversion example code, make sure that you have the following prerequisites.

{{% /blocks/products/pf/agp/text %}}

- Microsoft Windows or a compatible OS with C++ Runtime Environment for Windows 32 bit, Windows 64 bit and Linux 64 bit.
- Aspose.Slides for C++ DLL referenced in your project.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="PPSX to JPEG C++ Conversion Source Code" offSpacer="" %}}

```cs
// Load the PPSX
SharedPtr<Presentation> pres = MakeObject<Presentation>(u"sourceFile.ppsx");

// Access the first slide
SharedPtr<ISlide> slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);

// User defined dimension
int desiredX = 1200;
int desiredY = 800;

// Getting scaled value  of X and Y
float ScaleX = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Width()) * desiredX;
float ScaleY = (float)(1.0 / pres->get_SlideSize()->get_Size().get_Height()) * desiredY;

// Create a custom scale image
auto bitmap = slide->GetThumbnail(ScaleX, ScaleY);

bitmap->Save(u"output.jpeg", ImageFormat::get_Jpeg());
	
//Iterate through each slide via index and convert
