[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to create, convert, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, HTML docs, and other files. When you convert PNG to PPTX, you are essentially creating a PowerPoint presentation that contains slides based on PNG images.

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();

auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image.png"));
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);

pres->Save(u"pres.pptx", SaveFormat::Pptx);
