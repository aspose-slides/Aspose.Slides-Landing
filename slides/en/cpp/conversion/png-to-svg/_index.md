To convert the PNG to SVG, you will need to create Presentation from PNG file and save it as SVG.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="C++ code for converting PNG into SVG" offSpacer="true" %}}

```cpp

auto pres = System::MakeObject<Presentation>();
auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(0);
auto image = pres->get_Images()->AddImage(File::ReadAllBytes(u"image.png"));
slide->get_Shapes()->AddPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 10.0f, 10.0f, 100.0f, 100.0f, image);
for (int32_t index = 0; index < pres->get_Slides()->get_Count(); index++)
{
    auto fileName = String::Format(u"slide-{0}.svg", index);
    auto fileStream = System::MakeObject<FileStream>(fileName, FileMode::Create, FileAccess::Write);

    auto slide = pres->get_Slides()->idx_get(index);
    slide->WriteAsSvg(fileStream);
}

```
