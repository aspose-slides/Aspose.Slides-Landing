[**Aspose.Slides for C++**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/cpp/) is a powerful C++ library used to create, convert, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, HTML docs, and other files. When you convert JPG to PPTX, you are essentially creating a PowerPoint presentation that contains slides based on JPG images.
