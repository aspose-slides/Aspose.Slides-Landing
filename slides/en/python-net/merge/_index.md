[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) is a powerful Python library for creating and manipulating presentation files. Moreover, it provides flexible ways to combine multiple PPT/PPTX presentations. When you merge one presentation to another, you are effectively combining their slides in a single presentation to obtain one file. Aspose.Slides allows you merge two presentations in different ways. You get to merge presentations with all their shapes, styles, texts, formatting, comments, animations, etc. without having to worry about loss of quality or data.

To merge the PowerPoint presentations, you will need to clone the slides from one presentation to the other.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

# open first presentation
with slides.Presentation("presentation1.pptx") as pres1:
    # open second presentation
    with slides.Presentation("presentation2.pptx") as pres2:
        # loop through slides
        for slide in pres2.slides:
            # clone slide
            pres1.slides.add_clone(slide)
        # save merged presentation
        pres1.save("combined.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```

This python code demonstrates how merge several presentations into one and apply styles from slide master presentation template. So, result presentation will keep same source formatting and will contain formatting from master slide of another presentation.

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Merge multiple PPT into single in Python" offSpacer="true" %}}

```python

import aspose.slides as slides

files = ['pres1.pptx', 'pres2.pptx', 'pres3.pptx']

with slides.Presentation('master.pptx') as master:
    masterSlide = master.masters[0]

    for file in files:
        with slides.Presentation(file) as source:
            for slide in source.slides:
                clone = master.slides.add_clone(slide)

                for shape in masterSlide.shapes:
                    clone.shapes.add_clone(shape)
    
    master.save("combined.pptx", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPTX)
```
