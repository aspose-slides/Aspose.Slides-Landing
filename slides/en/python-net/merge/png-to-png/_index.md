[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) is a powerful Python library used to merge and manipulate presentations, images, and other files. When you merge PNG to PNG, you are effectively combining two images to get one picture.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/), you can merge PNG files quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="Python code for merging PNG to PNG" offSpacer="true" %}}
```python

import aspose.slides as slides
import aspose.pydrawing as drawing

with slides.Presentation() as pres:
    slide = pres.slides[0]
    image1 = pres.images.add_image(drawing.Bitmap("image1.png"))
	slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 0, 0, 100, 100, image1)

    image2 = pres.images.add_image(drawing.Bitmap("image2.png"))
	slide.shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 0, 200, 100, 100, image2)

    for sld in pres.slides:
        bmp = sld.get_thumbnail(1, 1)
        bmp.save("Slide_{num}.png".format(num=str(sld.slide_number)), drawing.imaging.ImageFormat.png)
```
