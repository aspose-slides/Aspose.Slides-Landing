[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) is a powerful Python library for creating and manipulating presentation files. Moreover, it provides flexible ways to combine multiple PPT presentations. When you merge one presentation to another, you are effectively combining their slides in a single presentation to obtain one file. Aspose.Slides allows you merge two presentations in different ways. You get to merge presentations with all their shapes, styles, texts, formatting, comments, animations, etc. without having to worry about loss of quality or data.

To merge the PowerPoint presentations, you will need to clone the slides from one presentation to the other.

```python

import aspose.slides as slides


with slides.Presentation("presentation1.ppt") as pres1:
    with slides.Presentation("presentation2.ppt") as pres2:
        for slide in pres2.slides:
            pres1.slides.add_clone(slide)
    pres1.save("presentation.pps", slides.export.SaveFormat.PPS)
```
