    svgImage = slides.SvgImage(svgContent)
    ppImage = pres.images.add_image(svgImage)
    pres.slides[0].shapes.add_picture_frame(slides.ShapeType.RECTANGLE, 0, 0, ppImage.width, ppImage.height, ppImage)
    for sld in pres.slides:
        bmp = sld.get_thumbnail(1, 1)
        bmp.save("Slide_{num}.png".format(num=str(sld.slide_number)), drawing.imaging.ImageFormat.png)
