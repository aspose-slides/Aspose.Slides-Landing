[**Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) is a powerful Python library used to create, convert, and manipulate PowerPoint presentations, PDFs, HTML docs, and other files. When you convert PNG to PPT, you are essentially creating a PowerPoint presentation that contains slides based on PNG images.
