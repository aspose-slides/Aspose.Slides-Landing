Need to convert PPTM files to EMF programmatically? Using [*Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET*](https://products.aspose.com/slides/python-net/) any developer can convert PPTM to EMF format with just a few lines of Python code.

As a modern presentation processing API, Aspose.Slides for Python creates EMF from PPTM quickly. Test the quality of PPTM to EMF conversion right in your [browser](https://products.aspose.app/slides/conversion). Aspose PowerPoint PPTX library allows you to convert PPTM files to many popular formats.

You can install the library from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Aspose.Slides/) using the following pip command:
