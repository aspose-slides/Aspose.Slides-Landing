Using Aspose.Slides for Python via .NET, you can add watermark to PPT presentation. Watermarks are an essential part of any presentation. They are used to protect the content of the presentation from being copied or used without permission. A watermark is a visible or invisible image or text that is placed on top of the presentation. It can be used to identify the owner of the presentation and to prevent unauthorized use. Watermarks can also be used to add a professional touch to the presentation and to make it look more polished.
