[**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/php-java/) is a powerful PHP library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, PDFs, images, and other files. When you merge TIFF to PDF, you are effectively combining images to obtain a single PDF file.

        fclose($f2);
    }
    
    $image1 = $pres->getImages()->addImage($contents1);
    $slide->getShapes()->addPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0, 0, 360, 540, $image1);
    
    $image2 = $pres->getImages()->addImage($contents2);
    $slide->getShapes()->addPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 360, 0, 360, 540, $image2);

    $pres->save("merged-pdf.pdf", SaveFormat::Pdf);
