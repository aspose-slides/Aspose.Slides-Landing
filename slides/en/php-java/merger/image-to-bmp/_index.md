[**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/php-java/) is a powerful PHP library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, PDFs, images, and other files. When you merge image to BMP, you are effectively combining images to obtain a single BMP file.

Using [**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/php-java/), you can merge image to BMP quickly with just a few lines of code

{{% blocks/products/pf/agp/code-block title="PHP code for merging Image to BMP" offSpacer="true" %}}
```php

<?php
require_once("http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/java/Java.inc");
require_once("lib/aspose.slides.php");

$pres = new Presentation();
try
{
    $slide = $pres->getSlides()->get_Item(0);
    
    $filename1 = 'image1.png';
    $f1 = fopen($filename1, 'r');
    if ($f1) {
        $contents1 = fread($f1, filesize($filename1));
        fclose($f1);
    }

    $filename2 = 'image1.png';
    $f2 = fopen($filename2, 'r');
    if ($f2) {
        $contents2 = fread($f2, filesize($filename2));
        fclose($f2);
    }
    
    $image1 = $pres->getImages()->addImage($contents1);
    $slide->getShapes()->addPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 0, 0, 360, 540, $image1);
    
    $image2 = $pres->getImages()->addImage($contents2);
    $slide->getShapes()->addPictureFrame(ShapeType::Rectangle, 360, 0, 360, 540, $image2);

    $img = $pres->getSlides()->get_Item(0)->getThumbnail(2, 2);
    $imageio = new Java("javax.imageio.ImageIO");
    $javafile = new Java("java.io.File", "merged-image.bmp");
    $imageio->write($img, "BMP", $javafile);
}
finally
{
    if ($pres != null) $pres->dispose();
