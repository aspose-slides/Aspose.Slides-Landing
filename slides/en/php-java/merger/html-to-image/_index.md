[**Aspose.Slides for PHP via Java**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/php-java/) is a powerful PHP library used to merge and manipulate presentations, HTML docs, and other files. When you merge HTML to image, you are effectively combining the contents in HTML documents to obtain a single image.

    $img = $pres->getSlides()->get_Item(0)->getThumbnail(2, 2);
    $imageio = new Java("javax.imageio.ImageIO");
