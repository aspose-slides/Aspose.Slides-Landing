[**Aspose.Slides for .NET**](https://products.aspose.com/slides/net/) is a powerful .NET library used to create, convert, merge, and manipulate presentations, HTML files, and other documents. When you merge HTML to HTML, you are effectively combining the contents from 2 documents to obtain one HTML file. Aspose.Slides allows you merge HTML docs in different ways. You get to merge HTML with all their texts, formatting,styles, etc.
